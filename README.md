# docker-ushahidi-platform

Docker container for [Ushahidi Platform][3]

"Make smart decisions with a data management system that rapidly collects data from the crowd and visualizes what happened, when and where."

note: You need to deploy the ushhidi-platform (quantumobject/docker-ushahidi-platform container ) and ushhidi-client (quantumobject/docker-ushahidi-client container) . 

## Install dependencies

  - [Docker][2]

To install docker in Ubuntu 18.04 use the commands:

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo bash < <(curl -sL https://get.docker.com/)

 To install docker in other operating systems check [docker online documentation][4]

## Usage

Before you be able to use this container you need first to deploy quantumoject/docker-ushahidi-platform and use the http://ip:port reference of it to _-e PLATFORM="http://ip:port"_ for entry for this container. 

To run container use the commands below:

    docker run -d -p 8080:80 --add-host platform-api:external_ip --add-host api.ushahidi.test:external_ip --name ushahidi-platform quantumobject/docker-ushahidi-platform

It will take some time to install, generate and configured files for container , need to check logs output to find the APP_KEY for the next Container, for the majority of cases external_ip and ip_platform will be the same :

    docker logs ushahidi-platform

    docker run -d -p 80:80 -e PLATFORM="http://ip_platform:8080" -e APP_KEY='.....' --name ushahidi-client quantumobject/docker-ushahidi-client
  
You need to wait few min for the application to finish installing the client before try to access it.

note: needed "--add-host platform-api:external_ip --add-host api.ushahidi.test:external_ip" to modified /etc/hosts inside of container.

## Accessing the Ushahidi Platform applications:

After that check with your browser at addresses plus the port assigined by docker:

  - **http://host_ip:port/**
